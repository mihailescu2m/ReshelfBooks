## What is BookScan?

BookScan is the app that remembers every book's place on your library's shelves — so any book can find its way back with a single scan.

Scan a book's barcode and the app instantly retrieves the title, author, year, and cover art. Assign the book to a named shelf — *"Living Room Top Row"*, *"Office Left"*, *"Kids Room"* — and BookScan remembers exactly where it lives. From that point on, any time a book ends up out of place, a single scan tells you where it belongs.

**The day-to-day usage:**

📚 **Building your library** — Walk to your shelves once and scan everything in. Each book gets assigned to its shelf in the app, creating a complete map of your physical library. No typing, no manual entry.

📍 **Putting books back** — Pulled a book out and not sure where it came from? Scan the barcode. The app instantly shows you the exact shelf to return it to. No more wandering around trying to remember where it lives.

🖥 **Always-on library assistant** — Leave an old iPad propped up on your bookshelf running BookScan full screen. It stays ready to scan at a moment's notice — no unlocking, no navigating. Just point and scan.

👧 **When kids rearrange your shelves** — Children pull books out constantly and rarely put them back in the right place. A quick scan on each displaced book tells you exactly where it belongs, turning a frustrating re-sort into a two-second job.

🤝 **Lending tracker** — Lend a book to someone with one tap. When they return it, scan the barcode: BookScan automatically clears the lent status and shows you which shelf to put it back on. If you can scan it, you have it back — it's that simple.

## Features

### Scanning & Lookup
- **Instant barcode scanning** — point the camera at an EAN-13 / ISBN-13 barcode and the book is identified in under a second
- **Manual ISBN entry** — type any ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 (with full check-digit validation) when a barcode is too worn to scan
- **Five-source lookup engine** — queries Open Library → Google Books → Open Library search → Crossref → Library of Congress in sequence; each covers a different sweet spot (classics & library-catalogued, popular modern, contemporary popular fiction & non-fiction, academic & textbooks, niche US-published & children's) so almost every book is found
- **Rich cover art** — searches eight sources concurrently (Open Library, Google Books ×3, WorldCat, Bookcover API, Better World Books, and Open Library search) and picks the best available image

### Library Management
- **Named shelves** — organise books into as many shelves as you like; drag between shelves at any time
- **Unshelved section** — books without a shelf always stay visible and accessible
- **Cover image editing** — change a cover from the camera, the photo library, or a web image search directly in the detail view
- **Full-text search** — find any book instantly by title, author, or ISBN with a 300 ms debounced search

### Lending Tracker
- **Lend a book** — one tap moves a book to the dedicated *Lent* shelf and remembers which shelf it came from
- **Return via barcode** — scanning a lent book's barcode automatically returns it to its original shelf; a confirmation screen shows where to put it back
- **Scan-to-return flow** — the scanner recognises lent books and triggers the return action immediately, no menus required

### Sync & Family Sharing
- **iCloud sync** — your library syncs silently across all your own devices via your private iCloud container
- **Family sharing** — share your whole library, read/write, with family (partner, kids): tap the share button, send an invite, and everyone sees and edits the same live library
- **Merged, equal access** — every member can scan, shelve, lend, and return; changes appear on the other devices within seconds
- **Conflict-safe** — owner-side maintenance and deterministic merge logic keep the shared library consistent under concurrent edits

### Privacy
- No tracking, no analytics, no third-party SDKs
- Camera access is used exclusively for barcode scanning
- Photo library access is opt-in and only used when you choose to set a cover image
- All data is stored in your private iCloud container — never on a third-party server

| Camera / scanning | AVFoundation (`AVCaptureSession`, EAN-13) |
| Image picking | PhotosUI (`PHPickerViewController`) |
| Book metadata | Open Library API, Google Books API |
| Cover images | Open Library Covers, Google Books, WorldCat, Bookcover API, Better World Books |
| Concurrency | Swift Structured Concurrency (`async/await`, `actor`, `async let`) |
| Logging | `os.log` (unified logging) |
| Tests | Swift Testing framework |

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| iOS | 18.0 |
| Xcode | 16.0 |
| Swift | 5.0 |
| iCloud account | Required for sync (app works offline without one) |

## Building & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihailescu2m/BookScan.git
   cd BookScan/BookScan
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open BookScan.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Sign the app**  
   In Xcode → *Signing & Capabilities*, select your Apple Developer team. Xcode will register the App ID and the CloudKit container (`iCloud.memeka.BookScan`) automatically on first build.

4. **Run on a device**  
   Select your iPhone or iPad as the run destination and press **⌘R**.  
   > A physical device is required for barcode scanning. The iOS simulator cannot access a camera.

5. **Run unit tests**  
   ```bash
   xcodebuild build-for-testing \
     -project BookScan.xcodeproj \
     -scheme BookScan \
     -destination 'generic/platform=iOS'
   ```

## Data Model

```
Library ──< Shelf
Library ──< Book
Shelf   ──< Book (shelf)
Shelf   ──< Book (previousShelf)   ← remembers original shelf while lent
```

A single hidden `Library` root owns every shelf and book; sharing that one object moves the whole graph into a shared CloudKit zone, so the entire library is shared (and new items automatically join it).

`Book.lend(to:)` stores `shelf` → `previousShelf` and moves the book to the lending shelf.  
`Book.returnBook()` restores `shelf = previousShelf` and clears `previousShelf`.

## API Credits

BookScan uses the following free, open APIs — no API keys required:

| Service | Used for |
|---|---|
| [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) | Book metadata (1st, catalog API; 3rd, search index) + cover images by ISBN and title/author search |
| [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) | Book metadata (2nd) + cover images (queried three ways: by ISBN, title+author, title) |
| [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) | Book metadata (4th) — academic, scientific, and university press titles |
| [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/apis/) | Book metadata (5th) — niche US-published, regional, children's, cookbooks, official publications |
| [WorldCat / OCLC](https://www.worldcat.org) | Cover images by ISBN — excellent coverage of academic, older, and non-English titles |
| [Bookcover API](https://bookcover.longitood.com) | Cover images by ISBN |
| [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com) | Cover images by ISBN |

All eight cover-image sources run **concurrently** and results are assembled in priority order, so the app shows the best available cover without waiting for slower sources. Crossref and the Library of Congress provide metadata only — cover images are handled by the other sources.
